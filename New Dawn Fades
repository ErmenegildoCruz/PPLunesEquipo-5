New Dawn Fades

siempre miras hacia el atardecer

There is no time to sleep, no time to fail
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say

We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
I give you all and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore

esta ojete este verso pero te lo llevas de almuerzo
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time
Hoping for something else
